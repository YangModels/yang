This is a python class that looks for capabilities.xml files and parse them to create a json dictionary out of xml file
and yang files accordingly. This json file is used with populate.py to populate a yangcatalog with data.

Steps of how it is done:
    1, Search for every capability xml file.
    2, Parse the path of location to get platform, OS-type, OS-version
    3, Iterate through capabilities in xml file and get Netconf version, capabilities and all supported modules
    4, For each supported module pull deviations, features and revision from capabilities xml file if there are any
    5, For each supported module use pyang to parse the module itself and pull rest of necessary information
    6, If Revision was not contained in capabilities xml file try to get it out of module too.
    7, Find recursively imported and included modules and again pull all the necessary information
    8, Create json dictionary out of parsed data`s and write them to file called 'normal{number-of-file}.json'
    9, Create prepare PUT data for yang in images.
