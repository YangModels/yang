      Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
      3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section 
      2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow

      recommendations in RFCs 1034 and 1123. Schema nodes
      representing host names should use the host-name type
      instead of the domain-type.

      The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
      to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
      prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
      byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted

      IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
      may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
      and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
      which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
      explicitly or may depend on the configuration of the
      resolver.

      Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
      format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
      domain names MUST be A-labels as per RFC 5890.";

      6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2.  Characters that can be
      represented without using percent-encoding are represented
      as characters (without percent-encoding), and all
      case-insensitive characters are set to lowercase except
      for hexadecimal digits within a percent-encoded triplet,
      which are normalized to uppercase as described in
      Section 6.2.2.1 of RFC 3986.

      The purpose of this normalization is to help provide
      unique URIs.  Note that this normalization is not
      sufficient to provide uniqueness.  Two URIs that are
      textually distinct after this normalization may still be
      equivalent.

      Objects using the uri type may restrict the schemes that
      they permit.  For example, 'data:' and 'urn:' schemes
      might not be appropriate.

      A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
      express 'URI absent' where required.
