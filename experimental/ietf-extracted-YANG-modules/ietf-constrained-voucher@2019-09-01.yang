description
  "This module defines the format for a voucher, which is produced
   by a pledge's manufacturer or delegate (MASA) to securely assign
   one or more pledges to an 'owner', so that the pledges may
   establis a secure connection to the owner's network
   infrastructure.

   This version provides a very restricted subset appropriate
   for very constrained devices.
   In particular, it assumes that nonce-ful operation is
   always required, that expiration dates are rather weak, as no
   clocks can be assumed, and that the Registrar is identified
   by a pinned Raw Public Key.

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
   'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
   and 'OPTIONAL' in the module text are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC 2119.";

             during the key agreement process, and it is wasteful
             to transmit the public key another two times.
             The use of a hash of public key info, at 32-bytes for
             sha256 is a significant savings compared to an RSA
             public key, but is only a minor savings compared to
             a 256-bit ECDSA public-key.

             specifications which define new leaf for other hash types";
