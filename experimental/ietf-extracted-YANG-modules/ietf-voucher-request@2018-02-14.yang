    It is a superset of the voucher itself.
    It provides content to the MASA for consideration

    NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',

             protocol path, then the previously signed voucher SHOULD be
             included in this field.

             For example, a pledge might sign a voucher request
             with a proximity-registrar-cert, and the registrar
             then includes it as the prior-signed-voucher-request field.
             This is a simple mechanism for a chain of trusted
             parties to change a voucher request, while
             maintaining the prior signature information.

             The Registrar and MASA MAY examine the prior signed
             voucher information for the
             purposes of policy decisions. For example this information
             could be useful to a MASA to determine that both pledge and
             registrar agree on proximity assertions. The MASA SHOULD
             remove all prior-signed-voucher-request information when
             signing a voucher for imprinting so as to minimize the
             final voucher size.";
