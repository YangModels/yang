  description
    'This YANG module defines the Telemetry Philatelist Index.
    These definitions are for Philatelist Network Controllers.

    A Network Controller with the Collector role programs one or more
    SOURCES (typically Network Elements) to generate a STREAM of 
    telemetry data. The STREAM is sent to a specific DESTINATION
    in a Time Series Database (TSDB).

    Each STREAM consists of timestamped sensor values from each
    sensor in a sensor group.
