  description
    "This module enables tracing of configuration changes in a
     network for the sake of automated correlation between
     configuration changes and the external request that triggered
     that change.

     The module stores the identifier of the parent transaction
     that triggered the change in a device, and the child
     transaction ID when the local device originates in its turn a
     transaction.
