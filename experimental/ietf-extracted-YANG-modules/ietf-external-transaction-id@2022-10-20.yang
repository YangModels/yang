  description
    "This module enables tracing of configuration changes in a
     network for the sake of automated correlation between
     configuration changes and the external request that triggered
     that change.

     The module stores the identifier of the trace, if any, that
     triggered the change in a device. If that trace-id was provided
     by a client, (i.e. not created locally by the server), the id
     of that client is stored as well to indicated which client
     triggered the configuration change.
