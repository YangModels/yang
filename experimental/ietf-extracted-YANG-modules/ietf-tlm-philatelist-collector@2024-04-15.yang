  description
    'This YANG module defines the Telemetry Philatelist Collector.
    These definitions are for Philatelist Network Controllers.

    A Network Controller with the Collector role programs one or more
    SOURCES (typically Network Elements) to generate a STREAM of 
    telemetry data. A SOURCE may be a Provider, or a proxy mechanism
    standing in for the Provider.
    The STREAM is then sent to a specific DESTINATION PARTITION
    in a Time Series Database (TSDB). Partitions are also known as
    buckets, intervals, segments, etc. in various implementations.

    Each STREAM consists of timestamped sensor values from each
    sensor in a sensor group.
