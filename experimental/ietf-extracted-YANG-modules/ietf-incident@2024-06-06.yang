  description
    "This module defines the interfaces for incident management
     lifecycle.

     This module is intended for the following use cases:
     * incident lifecycle management:
       - incident report: report incident instance to client
                          when an incident instance is detected.
       - incident acknowledge: acknowledge an incident instance.
       - incident diagnose: diagnose an incident instance.
       - incident resolve: resolve an incident instance.
