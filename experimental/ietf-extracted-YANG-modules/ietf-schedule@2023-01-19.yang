    "This YANG module defines two groupings for iCalendar (Internet
     Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification) data
     types:period of time and recurrence rule, for representing and
     exchanging calendaring and scheduling information. The YANG
     module complies with sections 3.3.9 and 3.3.10 in RFC 5545.
     Future extensions may define more as needed.
