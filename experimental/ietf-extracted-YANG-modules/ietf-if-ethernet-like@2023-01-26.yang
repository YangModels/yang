  description
    "This module contains YANG definitions for configuration for
     'Ethernet-like' interfaces.  It is applicable to all interface
     types that use Ethernet framing and expose an Ethernet MAC
     layer, and includes such interfaces as physical Ethernet
     interfaces, Ethernet LAG interfaces and VLAN sub-interfaces.

     Additional interface configuration and counters for physical
     Ethernet interfaces are defined in
     ieee802-ethernet-interface.yang, as part of IEEE Std
     802.3.2-2019.
