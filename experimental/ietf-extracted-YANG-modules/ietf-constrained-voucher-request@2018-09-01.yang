  description
   "This module defines the format for a voucher request,
    which is produced by a pledge to request a voucher.
    The voucher-request is sent to the potential owner's
    Registrar, which in turn sends the voucher request to
    the manufacturer or delegate (MASA).

    A voucher is then returned to the pledge, binding the
    pledge to the owner.  This is a constrained version of the
    voucher-request present in
    draft-ietf-anima-bootstrap-keyinfra.txt.

    This version provides a very restricted subset appropriate
    for very constrained devices.
    In particular, it assumes that nonce-ful operation is
    always required, that expiration dates are rather weak, as no
    clocks can be assumed, and that the Registrar is identified
    by a pinned Raw Public Key.

    The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
    'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY',
    and 'OPTIONAL' in the module text are to be interpreted as
    described in RFC 2119.";

            "If it is necessary to change a voucher, or re-sign and
             forward a voucher that was previously provided along a
             protocol path, then the previously signed voucher
             SHOULD be included in this field.

             For example, a pledge might sign a proximity voucher,
             which an intermediate registrar then re-signs to
             make its own proximity assertion.  This is a simple
             mechanism for a chain of trusted parties to change a
             voucher, while maintaining the prior signature
             information.

             The pledge MUST ignore all prior voucher information
             when accepting a voucher for imprinting. Other
             parties MAY examine the prior signed voucher
             information for the purposes of policy decisions.
             For example this information could be useful to a
             MASA to determine that both pledge and registrar
             agree on proximity assertions. The MASA SHOULD
             remove all prior-signed-voucher-request information when
             signing a voucher for imprinting so as to minimize the
             final voucher size.";
