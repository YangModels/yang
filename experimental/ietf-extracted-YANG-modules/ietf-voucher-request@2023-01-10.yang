             be included in this field.

             For example, a pledge might sign a voucher request
             with a proximity-registrar-cert, and the registrar
             then includes it as the prior-signed-voucher-request
             field.  This is a simple mechanism for a chain of
             trusted parties to change a voucher request, while
             maintaining the prior signature information.

             The Registrar and MASA MAY examine the prior signed
             voucher information for the
             purposes of policy decisions. For example this
             information could be useful to a MASA to determine
             that both pledge and registrar agree on proximity
             assertions. The MASA SHOULD remove all
             prior-signed-voucher-request information when
             signing a voucher for imprinting so as to minimize
             the final voucher size.";
