		 different manner.
          If the device is an OLT, then the following comparison is made:
          a)The received mode bit is ignored.
          b)If the received logical_link_id value matches 0x7FFF or 0x7FFE and 
		  an enabled MAC exists with alogical_link_id variable with the same 
		  value, then the comparison is considered a match to thatMAC.
          c)If the received logical_link_id has a value other than 0x7FFF or 
		  0x7FFE and an enabled MAC existswith a mode variable with a value of 
		  0 and a logical_link_id variable matching the receivedlogical_link_id 
		  value, then the comparison is considered a match to that MAC.
          If the device is an ONU then the following comparison is made:
          d)If the received mode bit is equal to 0 and the received 
		  logical_link_id value matches the logi-cal_link_id variable, 
		  then the comparison is considered a match.
          e)If the received mode bit is equal to 1 and the received 
		  logical_link_id value does not match thelogical_link_id variable, 
		  or the received logical_link_id matches 0x7FFE, then the comparison 
		  is considered a match.
          f)If the received logical_link_id value matches one of the assigned 
		  multicast LLIDs, then thecomparison is considered a match.
          If no match is found, then the packet shall be discarded within the 
		  RS. If a match is found, then the packet isintended to be transferred.
		  If the packet is transferred, then both octets of the LLID field 
		  shall be replacedwith normal preamble octets.
          If the packet is transferred, the one octet preceding the LLID is 
		  passed without modification. A number ofLLIDs have been reserved 
		  (see IEEE Std 802.3, Figure 76â€“4) for various purposes including 
		  downstream broadcast,discovery messages, and upstream registration 
		  request messages. An additional block of LLIDs has been setaside for 
		  future use and definition. A registered ONU shall not transmit frames 
		  with one of these reservedLLIDs.";
