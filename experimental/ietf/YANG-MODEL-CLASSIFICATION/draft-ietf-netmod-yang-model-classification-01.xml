  <abstract>
    <t>The YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> data modeling language is currently
      being considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the
      networking industry at large. Many standards-defining organizations
      (SDOs), open source software projects, vendors and users are using YANG to
      develop and publish models of configuration, state data and operations
      for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, there is currently
      no well-known terminology to categorize various types of YANG models.</t>

    <t>A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of models,
      assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling efforts in the IETF and
      other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-related discussions
      between the different groups.</t>

    <t>This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to
      support consistent classification of YANG models.</t>
  </abstract>

  <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
    <t>The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) has been actively
      encouraging IETF working groups to use the NETCONF
      <xref target="RFC6241"/> and YANG standards for configuration
      management purposes, especially in new working group charters
      <xref target="Writable-MIB-Module-IESG-Statement"/>.</t>

    <t>YANG is also gaining wide acceptance as the de-facto standard modeling
      language in the broader industry. This extends beyond the IETF,
      including many standards development organizations, industry consortia,
      ad hoc groups, open source projects, vendors, and end-users.</t>

    <t>There are currently no clear guidelines on how to classify the layering
      of YANG models according to abstraction, or how to classify models along
      the continuum spanning formal standards publications, vendor-specific
      models and models provided by end-users.</t>

    <t>This document presents a set of concepts and terms to form a useful
      taxonomy for consistent classification of YANG models in two dimensions:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>The layering of models based on their abstraction levels</t>
        <t>The type of model based on the nature and intent of the content</t>
      </list>
      The two categories are covered in the next two sections.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="firstdimension" title="First Dimension: YANG Model Abstraction Layers">
    <t>Model developers have taken two approaches to developing YANG models:
      top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach starts with high level
      abstractions modeling business or customer requirements and maps them to
      specific networking technologies. The bottom-up approach starts with
      fundamental networking technologies and maps them into more abstract
      constructs.</t>

	  <t>There are currently no specific requirements on, or well-defined best
      practices around the development of models. For the purpose of this
      document we assume that both approaches (bottom-up and top-down) will
      be used as they both provide benefits that appeal to different groups.
    </t>

	  <t>For layering purposes, this document suggests the classification of
      data models into two distinct abstraction layers:</t>
	   <t>
       <list style="symbols">
		     <t>Network Element YANG Models describe the configuration, state
          data and operations of specific device-centric technologies or
          features</t>
         <t>Network Service YANG Models describe the configuration, state
          data and operations of an abstract representation of a service
          implemented on one or multiple network elements</t>
	      </list>
      </t>

	   <t>Figure 1 illustrates the application of YANG models at different
      layers of abstraction. Layering of models allows for reusability of
      existing lower layer models by higher level models while limiting
      duplication of features across layers.</t>

    <t>For model developers, per-layer modeling allows for separation of
      concern across editing teams focusing on specific areas.</t>

    <t>As an example, experience from the IETF shows that creating useful
      network element YANG models for e.g. routing or switching protocols
      requires teams that include developers with experience of
      implementing those protocols.</t>

    <t>On the other hand, network service models are best developed by people
      experienced in defining network services for consumption by programmers
      developing e.g. flow-through provisioning systems or self-service
      portals.</t>

  <section anchor="networkservice" title="Network Service YANG Data Models">
    <t>Network Service YANG Data Models describe the characteristics of a
      service, as agreed upon with consumers of that service. That is, a
      service model does not expose the detailed configuration parameters of
      all participating network elements and features, but describes an
      abstract model that allows instances of the service to be decomposed
      into instance data according to the Network Element data models of
      the participating network elements. The service-to-element decomposition
      is a separate process with details depending on how the network operator
      chooses to realize the service. For the purpose of this document we
      will use the term "orchestrator" to describe a system implementing such
      a process.</t>

     <t>As an example, the Network Service model included in
      <xref target='YANG-Data-Model-for-L3VPN-service-delivery'/> provides
      an abstracted model for Layer 3 IP VPN service configuration. An
      orchestrator receives operations on service instances according to the
      service model and decomposes the data into specific Network Element
      models to configure the participating network elements to perform the
      intent of the service.</t>

     <t>Network Service YANG models define services models to be consumed 
      by external systems. These models are commonly designed, developed and
      deployed by network infrastructure teams.</t>

    <t>YANG allows for different design patterns to describe network services,
      ranging from monolithic to component-based approaches.</t>

    <t>The monolithic approach captures the entire service in a single model
      and does not put focus on reusability of internal data definitions and
      groupings. The monolithic approach has the advantages of single-purpose
      development including speed at the expense of reusability.</t>

    <t>The component-based approach captures device-centric features (e.g.
      the definition of a VRF, routing protocols, or packet filtering) in a
      vendor-independent manner. The components are designed for reuse across
      many services. The set of components required for a specific service is
      then composed into the higher-level service. The component-based
      approach has the advantages of modular development including a higher
      degree of reusability at the expense of initial speed.</t>

    <t>As an example, an L2VPN service can be built on many different types of
      transport network technologies, including e.g. MPLS or carrier ethernet.
      A component-based approach would allow for reuse of e.g. UNI-interface
      definitions independent of the underlying transport network (e.g. MEF
      UNI interface or MPLS interface). The monolithic approach would assume
      a specific set of transport technologies and interface definitions.</t>

   <section anchor="networkelement" title="Network Element YANG Data models">
    <t>Network Element YANG Data Models describe the configuration, state
      data and operations of a network device as defined by the vendor of
      that device. The models are commonly structured around features of the
      device, e.g. interface configuration <xref target='RFC7223'/>, OSPF
      configuration <xref target='I-D.ietf-ospf-yang'/>, and firewall rules
      definitions  <xref target='I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model'/>. The model
      provides a coherent data model representation of what is commonly a very
      mixed software environment consisting of the operating system and
      applications running on the device.</t>

    <t>The decomposition, ordering, and execution of changes to the operating
      system and application configuration is the task of the management
      framework that implements the YANG model.</t>

   </section>
 </section>

 <section title="Second Dimension: Model Types">
    <t>This document suggests classifying YANG model types as either standard
      YANG models, vendor-specific YANG models and extensions, and
      user-specific YANG models and extensions</t>

    <t>The suggested classification applies to both Network Element YANG Data
      Models and Network Service YANG Data Models.</t>

    <t>It is to be expected that real-world implementations of both Network
      Service and Network Element models will include a mix of all three types
      of models.</t>

    <section title="Standard YANG Models">
      <t>Standard YANG models are published by standards-defining organizations
        (SDOs). While there is no formal definition of what construes an SDO,
        a common feature is that they publish specifications along specific
        processes with content that reflects some sort of membership
        consensus. The specifications are developed for wide use among the
        membership or for audiences beyond that.</t>

      <t>The lifecycle of these models is driven by the editing cycle of the
        specification and not tied to a specific implementation.</t>

      <t>Examples of SDOs in the networking industry are the IETF, the IEEE and
        the MEF.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Vendor-specific YANG Models and Extensions">
      <t>Vendor-specific YANG models are developed by organizations with the
        intent to support a specific set of implementations under control of
        that organization. The intent of these models range from providing
        openly published YANG models that may eventually be contributed back
        to, or adopted by an SDO, to strictly internal YANG models not intended
        for external consumption.</t>

      <t>The lifecycle of these models are generally aligned with the release
        cycle of the product or open source software project deliverables.</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that there is an increasing amount of interaction
        between open source projects and SDOs in the networking industry. This
        includes open source projects implementing published standards as well
        as open source projects  contributing content to SDO processes.</t>

      <t>Vendors also develop Vendor-specific Extensions to standard models using
        YANG constructs for extending data definitions of previously published
        models. This is done using the ‘augment’ statement that allows locally
        defined data trees to be augmented into locations in externally defined
        data trees.</t>

      <t>Vendors use this to extend standard data models to cover the
        full scope of features in implementations, which commonly is broader
        than what is covered by the standard model.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="User-specific YANG Models and Extensions">
      <t>User-specific YANG models are developed by organizations that operate
        YANG-based infrastructure including devices and orchestrators. The
        intent of these models is to express the specific needs for a certain
        implementation, above and beyond what is provided by vendors.
      </t>

      <t>This model type obviously requires the infrastructure to support the
        introduction of user-provided models and extensions. This would include
        ability to describe the service-to-network decomposition in
        orchestrators and the model to configuration decomposition in devices.
      </t>

      <t>The lifecycle of these models are generally aligned with the change
        cadence of the infrastructure.</t>
