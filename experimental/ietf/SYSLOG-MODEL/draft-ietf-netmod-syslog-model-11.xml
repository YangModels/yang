   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Operating systems, processes and applications generate messages
        indicating their own status or the occurrence of events. These
        messages are useful for managing and/or debugging the network and its
        services. The BSD syslog protocol is a widely adopted protocol that
        is used for transmission and processing of the messages.</t>

        <t>Since each process, application and operating system was
        written somewhat independently, there is little uniformity to the
        content of syslog messages.  For this reason, no assumption is made
        upon the formatting or contents of the messages.  The protocol is
        simply designed to transport these event messages. No
        acknowledgement of the receipt is made.</t>

        <t>Essentially, a syslog process receives messages (from the kernel,
        processes, applications or other syslog processes) and processes
        those. The processing involves logging to a local file, displaying on
        console, user terminal, and/or relaying to syslog processes on other
        machines. The processing is determined by the "facility" that
        originated the message and the "severity" assigned to the message by
        the facility.</t>

        <t>We are using definitions of syslog protocol from [RFC5424] in this
        RFC.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
       target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Terminology">
       <t>The term "originator" is defined in [RFC5424]:
       an "originator" generates syslog content to be carried in a message.</t>

       <t>The terms "relay" and "collectors" are as defined in [RFC5424].</t>
     </section>

   </section>

   <section title="Problem Statement">
     <t>This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] configuration data model that
        may be used to configure the syslog feature running on a system. 
        YANG models can be used with network management 
        protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] to install, manipulate, and delete 
        the configuration of network devices.</t>

     <t>The data model makes use of the YANG "feature" construct which allows 
        implementations to support only those syslog features that lie
        within their capabilities.</t>

     <t>This module can be used to configure the syslog application conceptual 
        layers as implemented on the target system [RFC5424].</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Design of the Syslog Model">
     <t>The syslog model was designed by comparing various syslog features 
        implemented by various vendors' in different implementations.</t>

     <t>This draft addresses the common leafs between implementations and 
        creates a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary 
        features, if necessary. The base model is designed to be very simple 
        for maximum flexibility.</t>

     <t>Syslog consists of originators, and collectors. The following digram 
        shows syslog messages flowing from an originator,
        to collectors where suppression filtering can take place.</t>

     <t>Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in 
        their implementation. An example is included in 
        <xref target="extending_facilities">Extending Facilities</xref>.</t>

     <t>The leaves in the base syslog model actions container 
        correspond to each message collector:</t>

     <t>
       <list style="empty">
         <t>console</t>
         <t>log buffer</t>
         <t>log file(s)</t>
         <t>remote relay(s)/collector(s)</t>
         <t>user session(s).</t>
       </list>
     </t>

     <t>Within each action, a selector is used to filter syslog messages. A 
        selector consists of two parts: one or more facility-severity matches, 
        and if supported via the select-match feature, an optional regular expression 
        pattern match that is performed on the SYSLOG-MSG field.</t>

     <t>The facility is one of a specific syslogtypes:syslog-facility, none, or all 
        facilities. None is a special case that can be used to disable an action.</t>

     <t>The severity is one of syslogtypes:severity, all severities, or none. None is 
        a special case that can be used to disable a facility. When filtering severity, 
        the default comparison is that all messages of the specified severity and higher 
        are logged. This is shown in the model as ?default equals-or-higher?. This 
        behavior can be altered if the select-sev-compare feature is enabled to 
        specify: ?equals? to specify only this single severity; ?not-equals? to ignore 
        that severity; ?equals-or-higher? to specify all messages of the specified 
        severity and higher.</t>

     <t>Optional features are used to specified functionality that is  
        present in specific vendor configurations.</t>

     <section title="Syslog Module">
       <t>A simplified graphical representation of the complete data tree is
          presented here.</t>

       <t>Each node is printed as:</t>

       <t>&lt;status> &lt;flags> &lt;name> &lt;opts> &lt;type> &lt;if-features></t>

       <t>&lt;status> is one of:

          x  for deprecated
          o  for obsolete
         </artwork></figure></t>

       <t>&lt;flags> is one of:
         <figure><artwork>
          rw  for configuration data
          ro  for non-configuration data
          -x  for rpcs
          -n  for notifications
         </artwork></figure></t>

       <t>&lt;name> is the name of the node
         <figure><artwork>
          (&lt;name>) means that the node is a choice node
          :(&lt;name>) means that the node is a case node
         </artwork></figure></t>

       <t>If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its
          name is printed as &lt;prefix>:&lt;name>.</t>

       <t>&lt;opts> is one of:
         <figure><artwork>
          ?  for an optional leaf or choice
          !  for a presence container
          *  for a leaf-list or list
          [&lt;keys>] for a list's keys
         </artwork></figure></t>

       <t>&lt;type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists</t>

       <t>If the type is a leafref, the type is printed as "-> TARGET", where
          TARGET is either the leafref path, with prefixed removed if possible.</t>

       <t>&lt;if-features> is the list of features this node depends on, printed
          within curly brackets and a question mark "{...}?"</t>

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
     <t>The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
        the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
        is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
        transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
        model [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
        particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
        NETCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

        <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
        writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
        default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
        in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., &lt;edit-config>)
        to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
        effect on network operations.</t>

     <section title="Resource Constraints">
       <t>Network administrators must take the time to estimate the appropriate
          memory limits caused by the configuration of actions/buffer using
          buffer-limit-bytes and/or buffer-limit-messages where necessary to
          limit the amount of memory used.</t>

       <t>Network administrators must take the time to estimate the appropriate
          storage capacity caused by the configuration of actions/file using
          file-archive attributes to limit storage used.</t>

       <t>It is the responsibility of the network administrator to ensure that
          the configured message flow does not overwhelm system resources.</t>

       <t>Many vendors extend the list of facilities available for logging in 
          their implementation. Additional facilities may not work with the
          syslog protocol as defined in [RFC5424] and hence such facilities
          apply for local syslog-like logging functionality.</t>
       <t>The following is an example that shows how additional 
          facilities could be added to the list of available facilities (in
          this example two facilities are added):</t>
