Primarily the classification is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but the model also has support for matching on some other layer 2 frame header fields and is designed to be easily extensible to match on other arbitrary header fields.</t><t>The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being based on membership of a 802.1Q VLAN bridge.</t></abstract></front><middle><section title="Introduction"><t>This document defines two YANG <xref target="RFC6020">RFC 6020</xref> modules that augment the encapsulation choice YANG element defined in <xref target="I-D.wilton-netmod-intf-ext-yang">Interface Extensions YANG</xref> and the generic interfaces data model defined in <xref target="RFC7223">RFC&nbsp;7223</xref>.  The two modules provide configuration nodes to support classification of Ethernet/VLAN traffic to sub-interfaces, that can have interface based feature and service configuration applied to them.  In the case of layer 2 Ethernet services, the flexible encapsulation module also supports flexible rewriting of the VLAN tags contained the in frame header.</t><t> For reference, a comparison between the sub-interface based YANG model documented in this draft and an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model is described in <xref target="comparison"/>.</t><t>
  In summary, the YANG modules defined in this internet draft are:
   <list><t>if-l3-vlan.yang - Defines the model for basic classification of VLAN tagged traffic to L3 transport services</t><t>flexible-encapsulation.yang - Defines the model for flexible classification of Ethernet/VLAN traffic to L2 transport services</t></list>
   </t><t> In addition, the yang module dot1q-types.yang, that provides definitions for common ways of identifying frames using fields from the 802.1Q VLAN tag, is included in this draft as a temporary reference. The intention is that this module, or at least a subset of it, is standardized through IEEE 802.1 and subsequently referenced from this draft rather than included in it. The expectation would be for any remaining parts to be standardized as part of this document.</t><!--      <section title="Requirements Language">

      The L3 Interface VLAN model provides appropriate leaves for termination of an 802.1Q VLAN tagged segment to a sub-interface based L3 service.  It allows
      for termination of traffic with up to two 802.1Q VLAN tags.

            ]]></artwork></figure></section><section title="Flexible Encapsulation Model"><t>The Flexible Encapsulation model is designed to allow for the flexible provisioning of layer 2 services. It provides the capability to classify Ethernet/VLAN
      frames received on an Ethernet trunk interface to sub-interfaces based on the fields available in the layer 2 headers. Once classified to sub-interfaces, it provides the capability
      to selectively modify fields within the layer 2 headers before the frame is handed off to the appropriate forwarding code for further handling.</t><t>The model supports a common core set of layer 2 header matches based on the 802.1Q tag type and VLAN Ids contained within the header up to a tag stack depth of two tags.</t><t>The model supports flexible rewrites of the layer 2 frame header for data frames as they are processed on the interface. It defines a set of standard tag manipulations that allow for the insertion, removal, or rewrite of one or two 802.1Q VLAN tags. The expectation is that manipulations are generally implemented in a symmetrical fashion, i.e. if a manipulation is performed on ingress traffic on an interface then the reverse manipulation is always performed on egress traffic out of the same interface. However, the model also allows for asymmetrical rewrites, which may be required to implement some forwarding models (such as E-Tree).</t><t>The structure of the model is currently limited to matching or rewriting a maximum of two 802.1Q tags in the frame header but has been designed to
      be easily extensible to matching/rewriting three or more VLAN tags in future, if required.</t><t>The final aim for the model design is for it to be cleanly extensible to add in additional match and rewrite criteria of the layer 2 header, such as
      matching on the source or destination MAC address, PCP or DEI fields in the 802.1Q tags, or the EtherType of the frame payload.  Rewrites can also be
      extended to allow for modification of other fields within the layer 2 frame header.</t><figure><preamble>The "flexible-encapsulation" YANG module has the following structure:</preamble><artwork><![CDATA[

This raises the valid question as to whether the models overlap and whether it is necessary or beneficial to have two different models for superficially similar constructs.  This section aims to answer that question by summarizing and comparing the two models.</t><section title="Sub-interface based configuration model overview"><t>The key features of the sub-interface based configuration model can be summarized as:
          <list style="symbols"><t>The model is primarily designed to enable layer 2 and layer 3 services on Ethernet interfaces that can be defined in a very flexible way to meet the varied requirements of service providers.</t><t>Traffic is classified from an Ethernet-like interface to sub-interfaces based on fields in the layer 2 header. This is often based on VLAN Ids contained in the frame, but the model is extensible to other arbitrary fields in the frame header.</t><t>Sub-interfaces are just a type of if:interface and hence support any feature configuration YANG models that can be applied generally to interfaces. For example, QoS or ACL models that reference if:interface can be applied to the sub-interfaces, or the sub-interface can be used as an Access Circuit in L2VPN or L3VPN models that reference if:interface.</t><t>In the sub-interface based configuration model, the classification of traffic arriving on an interface to a given sub-interface, based on fields in the layer 2 header, is completely independent of how the traffic is forwarded. The sub-interface can be referenced (via references to if:interface) by other models that specify how traffic is forwarded; thus sub-interfaces can support multiple different forwarding paradigms, including but not limited to: layer 3 (IPv4/IPv6), layer 2 pseudowires (over MPLS or IP), VPLS instances, EVPN instance.</t><t>The model is flexible in the scope of the VLAN Identifier space.  I.e. by default VLAN Ids can be scoped locally to a single Ethernet-like trunk interface, but the scope is determined by the forwarding paradigm that is used.</t></list>
          </t></section><section title="IEEE 802.1Q Bridge Configuration Model Overview"><t>The key features of the IEEE 802.1Q bridge configuration model can be summarized as:
          <list style="symbols"><t>Each VLAN bridge component has a set of Ethernet interfaces that are members of that bridge. Sub-interfaces are not used, nor required in the 802.1Q bridge model.</t><t>Within a VLAN bridge component, the VLAN tag in the packet is used, along with the destination MAC address, to determine how to forward the packet. Other forwarding paradigms are not supported by the 802.1Q model.</t><t>Classification of traffic to a VLAN bridge component is based only on the Ethernet interface that it arrived on.</t><t>VLAN Identifiers are scoped to a VLAN bridge component. Often devices only support a single bridge component and hence VLANs are scoped globally within the device.</t><t>Feature configuration is specified in the context of the bridge, or particular VLANs on a bridge.</t></list>
          </t></section><section title="Possible Overlap Between the Two Models"><t>Both models can be used for configuring similar basic layer 2 forwarding topologies. The 802.1Q bridge configuration model is optimised for configuring Virtual LANs that span across enterprises and data centers.</t><t>The sub-interface model can also be used for configuring equivalent Virtual LAN networks that span across enterprises and data centers, but often requires more configuration to be able to configure the equivalent constructs to the 802.1Q bridge model.</t><t>The sub-interface model really excels when implementing flexible L2 and L3 services, where those services may be handled on the same physical interface, and where the VLAN Identifier is being solely used to identify the customer or service that is being provided rather than a Virtual LAN.  The sub-interface model provides more flexibility as to how traffic can be classified, how features can be applied to traffic streams, and how the traffic is to be forwarded.</t><t>Conversely, the 802.1Q bridge model can also be use to implement L2 services in some scenarios, but only if the forwarding paradigm being used to implement the service is the native Ethernet forwarding specified in 802.1Q - other forwarding paradigms such as pseudowires or VPLS are not supported. The 802.1Q bridge model does not implement L3 services at all, although this can be partly mitigated by using a virtual L3 interface construct that is a separate logical Ethernet-like interface which is a member of the bridge.</t><t>In conclusion, it is valid for both of these models to exist since they have different deployment scenarios for which they are optimized.  Devices may choose which of the models (or both) to implement depending on what functionality the device is being designed for.</t></section></section><!--    <section anchor="app-additional" title="Additional Stuff">
