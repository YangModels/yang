1.  Introduction

   Access Control List (ACL) are one of the basic elements to configure
   device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking concepts
   such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.

   An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
   networking device.  Each rule is represented by an Access Control
   Entry (ACE).

   Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action
   criteria.

   The match criteria consist of tuple of match criteria and metadata
   matching.

   o  Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
      as address or class of service or port numbers.

   o  Metadata matching applies to fields associated with the packet but
      not in the packet header such as input interface or overall packet
      length

   The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
   criteria is met.  These can be any sort of thing from counting to
   policing or simply forwarding.The list of potential actions is
   endless depending on the innovations of the networked devices.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration of ACLs.  It is very important that model can be easily
   reused between vendors and between applications.

   ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
   filter constructs and Actions that they support.  Therefore this

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                    June 2014


   draft proposes a simple model that augmented by vendor proprietary
   models.

3.  Design of the ACL Model

   Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
   common understanding of what an access list is.  An access list
   contains an ordered list of rules called access list entries - ACEs.
   Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of
   subsequent ACEs.  Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group
   of action criteria.  The match criteria consist of packet header
   matching and metadata matching.  Packet header matches apply to
   fields visible in the packet such as address or class of service or
   port numbers.  Metadata matching applies to fields associated with
   the packet, but not in the packet header such as input interface,
   packet length, or source or destination prefix length.  The actions
   can be any sort of thing from logging to rate limiting or dropping to
   simply forwarding.  There is a default ACE which applies if a packet
   does not match any of the other ACEs.  As some devices fail closed
   (reject), some fail open (accept) with no explicit configuration,
   this model defines daufault action, ACE which applies if a packet
   does not match any of the other ACEs.  This will help with cross
   platform conformitiy and for that reason this draft specifies deny as
   default action.  There is overall operational state for the ACL and
   operational state for each ACE, and depending on the action,
   operational state for each action.  Access-lists can also have
   notifications such as logging, configuration changing, activation
   state changes.  The ACL can be applied to targets within the device
   which may be interfaces of a networked device, applications or
   features running in the device, or other objects.  When applied to
   interfaces of the networked device, the ACL is applied in a direction
   which indicates if it should be applied to packet entering (input) or
   leaving the device (output).

   This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
   create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   models.  The base model is very simple and with this design we hope
   to achieve needed flexibility for each vendor to extend the base
   model.

3.1.  ACL Modules

   There are three YANG modules in the model.  The first module, "ietf-
   acl", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to all ACLs
   regardless of their type or vendor.  In effect, the module can be
   viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass".  It imports module
   "packet-headers" into the match container.  The packet headers can be
   extended with different types and fragments.The packet headers

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                    June 2014


   modules can easily be extended to reuse definitions from other
   modules such as IPFIX [RFC5101] or migrate proprietary augmented
   module definitions into the standard module.

   Two other module "newco-acl" is example of company proprietary model,
   that augments the ietf-acl module with definitions that are specific
   to match criteria and company proprietary extensions to match and
   action criteria.  The model below is shown just an example and it is
   expected from vendors to create their own propietary models, based on
   the example below.

4.  ACL YANG Models

4.1.  IETF-ACL module

   "ietf-acl" is the standard top level module for Access lists.  It has
   a container for "access-list" to store access list information.  This
   container has information identifying the access list by a name("acl-
   name") and a list("access-list-entries") of rules associated with the
   "acl-name".  Each of the entries in the list("access-list-entries")
   indexed by the string "rule-name" have containers defining "matches"
   and "actions".  The "matches" define criteria used to identify
   patterns in "packet-fields".  The "actions" define behavior to
   undertake once a "match" has been identified.

module ietf-acl {
    yang-version 1;

    namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-acl";

    prefix ietf-acl;

4.2.  Packet Header module

   The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching on
   fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, transport layer
   fields and metadata.  These groupings can be augmented to include
   other proprietary matching criteria.  Since the number of match
   criteria is very large, the base draft does not include these
   directly but references them by "uses" to keep the base module
   simple.

4.3.  A company proprietary module example

   In the figure below is an example how proprietary models can be
   created on top of base ACL module.  It is a simple example of how to
   use 'augment' with an XPath expression which extends instances of a
   particular type.  In this example, all /ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl
   :access-list-entries/ietf-acl:matches are augmented with a new
   choice, protocol-payload-choice.  The protocol-payload-choice uses a
   grouping with an enumeration of all supported protocol values.  In
   other example, /ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl:access-list-entries/
   ietf-acl:actions are augmented with new choice of actions.  Here is
   an inclusive list of cases listed within a choice statement.

module newco-acl {
    yang-version 1;

    namespace "urn:newco:params:xml:ns:yang:newco-acl";

    prefix newco-acl;

    import ietf-acl {
      prefix "ietf-acl";
    }

    revision 2014-05-21{
      description "creating newo proprietary extensions to ietf-acl model";
    }

    augment "/ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl:access-list-entries/ietf-acl:matches" {
      description "Newco proprietry simple filter matches";
         choice protocol-payload-choice {
           list protocol-payload {
             key value-keyword;
             ordered-by user;
             description "Match protocol payload";
             uses match-simple-payload-protocol-value;
           }
      }
    }

    augment "/ietf-acl:access-list/ietf-acl:access-list-entries/ietf-acl:actions" {
      description "Newco proprietary simple filter actions";
      choice action {
         case count {
            description "Count the packet in the named counter";
               leaf count {
                  type string;
               }

         }
      }
    }

  grouping match-simple-payload-protocol-value {
     leaf value-keyword {
       description "(null)";
       type enumeration {
         enum icmp {
           description "Internet Control Message Protocol";
         }
         enum icmp6 {
           description "Internet Control Message Protocol Version 6";
         }
         enum range {
           description "Range of values";
         }
       }
     }
   }
}

   Dratf authors expect that different vendors will provide their own
   yang models as in the example above, which is the extension of the
   base model

4.4.  An ACL Example

   Requirement: Deny All traffic from 1.1.1.1 bound for host 2.2.2.2
   from leaving.

   In order to achieve the requirement, an name access control list is
   needed.  The acl and aces can be described in CLI as the following:

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                    June 2014


           access-list ip iacl
           deny tcp 1.1.1.1 host 2.2.2.2

                                 Figure 1

   Here is the example acl configuration xml:

           <rpc message-id="101" xmlns:nc="urn:cisco:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-acl:1.0">
         // replace with IANA namespace when assigned
           <edit-config>
         <target>
           <running/>
         </target>
         <config>
           <top xmlns="http://example.com/schema/1.2/config">
             <access-list>
               <acl-name>sample-ip-acl</acl-name>
               <access-list-entries>
             <rule-name>telnet-block-rule</rule-name>
             <matches>
               <destination-ipv4-address>2.2.2.2</destination-ipv4-address>
               <source-ipv4-address>1.1.1.1</source-ipv4-address>
             </matches>
             <action>
               <packet-handling>deny</packet-handling>
             </action>
               </access-list-entries>
             </access-list>
           </top>
         </config>
           </edit-config>
         </rpc>

5.  Linux nftables

   As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
   the Linux data model is changing.  Previously ACLs in Linux were
   highly protocol specific and different utilities were used for it
   (iptables, ip6tables, arptables, ebtables).  Recently, this has
   changed and a single utility, nftables, has been provided.  This
   utility follows very similarly the same base model as proposed in
   this draft.  The nftables support input and output ACEs and each ACE
   can be defined with match and action.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242] [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   TBD: List specific Subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688]
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-acl

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-acl namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-acl
   prefix: ietf-acl reference: RFC XXXX
