			<t>This document describes a data model of Access Control List (ACL) basic building blocks.

		<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
			<t>Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements to configure
   device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking concepts
   such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.</t>
			<t>An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
   networking device.  Each rule is represented by an Access Control
   Entry (ACE).</t>
			<t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria.</t>
			<t>The match criteria consist of a tuple of packet header match criteria and metadata match criteria.</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such as
      address or class of service or port numbers.</t>
					<t>Metadata matches apply to fields associated with the packet but
     not in the packet header such as input interface or overall packet length</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching criteria is
   met. These actions are any operations that would apply to the packet,  such as counting, policing, or simply
   forwarding.The list of potential actions is endless depending on the
   innovations of the networked devices.</t>

		<section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
			<t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> data model for the configuration of ACLs. It is very important that model can be easily reused between vendors and between applications.</t>
			<t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the filter constructs and actions that they support. Therefore this draft proposes a simple model that can be augmented by vendor proprietary models. </t>
		</section>
		<!-- problem -->
		<section anchor="design" title="Design of the ACL Model">
			<t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a common understanding of what access control list (ACL) is. A network system usually have a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered list of rules, also known as access list entries – ACEs. Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria. The match criteria consist of packet header matching and metadata matching. Packet header matching applies to fields visible in the packet such as address or class of service or port numbers.  Metadata matching applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the packet header such as input interface, packet length, or source or destination prefix length. The actions can be any sort of operation from logging to rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding. Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of subsequent ACEs. The model also includes overall operational state for the ACL and operational state for each ACE, targets where the ACL applied. One ACL can be applied to multiple targets within the device, such as interfaces of a networked device, applications or features running in the device, etc. When applied to interfaces of a networked device, the ACL is applied in a direction which indicates if it should be applied to packet entering (input) or leaving the device (output).</t>
			<t>This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models. The base model is very simple and with this design we hope to achieve needed flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.</t>
			<section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
				<t>There are two YANG modules in the model. The first module, "ietf-acl", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor. In effect, the module can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass". It imports the second module, "ietf-packet-fields". The match container in "ietf-acl" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields". The "ietf-packet-fields" modules can easily be extended to reuse definitions from other modules such as IPFIX <xref target="RFC5101"/> or migrate proprietary augmented module definitions into the standard module.</t>

			<section anchor="routeacl" title="Example of extending existing model for route filtering">
				<t>With proposed modular design, it is easy to extend the model with
					other features. Those features can be standard features, like route
					filters. Route filters match on specific IP addresses or ranges of
					prefixes. Much like ACLs, they include some match criteria and
					corresponding match action(s). For that reason, it is very simple to
					extend existing ACL model with route filtering. The combination of a
					route prefix and prefix length along with the type of match determines
					how route filters are evaluated against incoming routes. Different
					vendors have different match types and in this model we are using only
					 ones that are common across all vendors participating in this draft.
					As in this example, the base ACL model can be extended with company
					proprietary extensions, described in the next section.
