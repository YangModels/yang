1.  Introduction

   Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements to configure
   device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking concepts
   such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.

   An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
   networking device.  Each rule is represented by an Access Control
   Entry (ACE).

   Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action
   criteria.

   The match criteria consist of a tuple of packet header match criteria
   and metadata match criteria.

   o  Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
      as address or class of service or port numbers.

   o  Metadata matches apply to fields associated with the packet but
      not in the packet header such as input interface or overall packet
      length

   The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
   criteria is met.  These actions are any operations that would apply
   to the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding.The
   list of potential actions is endless depending on the innovations of
   the networked devices.

   Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh
   l]) or Access List.  In this document, Access Control List, ACL and
   Access List are interchangeable.

2.  Problem Statement

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration of ACLs.  It is very important that model can be easily
   reused between vendors and between applications.

   ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
   filter constructs and actions that they support.  Therefore this
   draft proposes a simple model that can be augmented by standard
   extensions and vendor proprietary models.

3.  Design of the ACL Model

   Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
   common understanding of what access control list (ACL) is.  A network
   system usually have a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered
   list of rules, also known as access list entries - ACEs.  Each ACE
   has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria.  The
   match criteria consist of packet header matching and metadata
   matching.  Packet header matching applies to fields visible in the
   packet such as address or class of service or port numbers.  Metadata
   matching applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the
   packet header such as input interface, packet length, or source or
   destination prefix length.  The actions can be any sort of operation
   from logging to rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding.
   Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no processing of
   subsequent ACEs.  The model also includes a container to hold overall
   operational state for each ACL and operational state for each ACE.
   One ACL can be applied to multiple targets within the device, such as
   interfaces of a networked device, applications or features running in
   the device, etc.  When applied to interfaces of a networked device,
   the ACL is applied in a direction which indicates if it should be
   applied to packet entering (input) or leaving the device (output).
   An example in the appendix shows how to express it in YANG model.

   This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
   create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary
   models.  The base model is very simple and with this design we hope
   to achieve needed flexibility for each vendor to extend the base
   model.

3.1.  ACL Modules

   There are two YANG modules in the model.  The first module, "ietf-
   access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects which are common to
   all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor.  In effect, the module
   can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass".  It imports
   the second module, "ietf-packet-fields".  The match container in
   "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields".
   If there is a need to define new "matches" choice, such as IPFIX
   [RFC5101], the container "matches" can be augmented.

4.  ACL YANG Models

4.1.  IETF Access Contorl List module

   "ietf-access-control-list" is the standard top level module for
   access lists.  The "access-lists" container stores a list of "acl".
   Each "acl" has information identifying the access list by a
   name("acl-name") and a list("access-list-entries") of rules
   associated with the "acl-name".  Each of the entries in the
   list("access-list-entries"), indexed by the string "rule-name", has
   containers defining "matches" and "actions".  The "matches" define
   criteria used to identify patterns in "ietf-packet-fields".  The
   "actions" define behavior to undertake once a "match" has been
   identified.

4.2.  IETF-PACKET-FIELDS module

   The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching on
   fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, transport layer
   fields and metadata.  Since the number of match criteria is very
   large, the base draft does not include these directly but references
   them by "uses" to keep the base module simple.  In case more match
   conditions are needed, those can be added by augmenting choices
   within container "matches" in ietf-access-control-list.yang model

4.3.  An ACL Example

   Requirement: Deny All traffic from 10.10.10.1/24.

   Here is the acl configuration xml for this Access Control List:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <data xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
    <access-lists xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
      <acl>
        <acl-name>sample-ipv4-acl</acl-name>
        <acl-type>ipv4-acl</acl-type>
        <access-list-entries>
          <ace>
            <rule-name>rule1</rule-name>
            <matches>
              <source-ipv4-network>
                10.10.10.1/24
              </source-ipv4-network>
            </matches>
            <actions>
              <deny />
            </actions>
          </ace>
        </access-list-entries>
      </acl>
    </access-lists>
  </data>

   The acl and aces can be described in CLI as the following:

         access-list ip sample-ip-acl
         deny tcp 10.10.10.1/24 any

4.4.  Port Range Usage Example

   When a lower-port and an upper-port are both present, it represents a
   range between lower-port and upper-port with both the lower-port and
   upper-port are included.  When only a lower-port presents, it
   represents a single port.

   With the follow XML snippet:

        <source-port-range>
          <lower-port>16384</lower-port>
          <upper-port>16387</upper-port>
        </source-port-range>

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                   March 2016


   This represents source ports 16384,16385, 16386, and 16387.

   With the follow XML snippet:

         <source-port-range>
           <lower-port>16384</lower-port>
           <upper-port>65535</upper-port>
         </source-port-range>


   This represents source ports greater than/equal to 16384.

   With the follow XML snippet:

         <source-port-range>
           <lower-port>21</lower-port>
         </source-port-range>


   This represents port 21.

5.  Linux nftables

   As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
   the Linux data model is changing.  Previously ACLs in Linux were
   highly protocol specific and different utilities were used (iptables,
   ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
   Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been
   developed.  With a single application, it has a single data model for
   filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the ietf-access-
   control list module proposed in this draft.  The nftables support
   input and output ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match and
   action.

   The example in Section 4.3 can be configured using nftable tool as
   below.

      nft add table ip filter
      nft add chain filter sample-ip-acl
      nft add rule ip filter sample-ip-acl ip protocol tcp ip saddr 10.10.10.1/24 drop

   The configuration entries added in nftable would be.

Internet-Draft               ACL YANG model                   March 2016


         table ip filter {
           chain sample-ip-acl {
             ip protocol tcp ip saddr 10.10.10.1/24 drop
           }
         }


   We can see there are many similarities between Linux nftables and
   IETF ACL YANG data models and its extension models.  It should be
   fairly easy to do translation between ACL YANG model described in
   this draft and Linux nftables.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242] [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control
   model [RFC6536] [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for
   particular NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available
   NETCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   /access-lists/acl/access-list-entries: This list specifies all the
   configured access list entries on the device.  Unauthorized write
   access to this list can allow intruders to access and control the
   system.  Unauthorized read access to this list can allow intruders to
   spoof packets with authorized addresses thereby compromising the
   system.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688]
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registration is requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-packet-fields

8.  Acknowledgements

   Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
   an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings.  That draft
   included an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters,
   and acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula
   Kraiser, Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen,
   and Phil Shafer.  Many people have reviewed the various earlier
   drafts that made the draft went into IETF charter.

   Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
   Blair each evaluated the YANG model in previous draft separately and
   then work together, to created a new ACL draft that can be supported
   by different vendors.  The new draft removes vendor specific
   features, and gives examples to allow vendors to extend in their own
   proprietary ACL.  The earlier draft was superseded with the new one
   that received more participation from many vendors.

   Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
   Schoenwalder for their review of and suggestions to the draft.

Appendix A.  Extending ACL model examples

A.1.  Example of extending existing model for route filtering

   With proposed modular design, it is easy to extend the model with
   other features.  Those features can be standard features, like route
   filters.  Route filters match on specific IP addresses or ranges of
   prefixes.  Much like ACLs, they include some match criteria and
   corresponding match action(s).  For that reason, it is very simple to
   extend existing ACL model with route filtering.  The combination of a
   route prefix and prefix length along with the type of match
   determines how route filters are evaluated against incoming routes.
   Different vendors have different match types and in this model we are
   using only ones that are common across all vendors participating in
   this draft.  As in this example, the base ACL model can be extended
   with company proprietary extensions, described in the next section.

A.2.  A company proprietary module example

   Module "example-newco-acl" is an example of company proprietary model
   that augments "ietf-acl" module.  It shows how to use 'augment' with
   an XPath expression to add additional match criteria, action
   criteria, and default actions when no ACE matches found.  All these
   are company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
   "example-newco-acl" is just an example and it is expected from
   vendors to create their own proprietary models.

   The following figure is the tree structure of example-newco-acl.  In
   this example, /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:access-
   list-entries/ ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:matches are augmented with a new
   choice, protocol-payload-choice.  The protocol-payload-choice uses a
   grouping with an enumeration of all supported protocol values.  In
   other example, /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:access-
   list-entries/ ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:actions are augmented with new
   choice of actions.

   Draft authors expect that different vendors will provide their own
   yang models as in the example above, which is the augmentation of the
   base model

A.3.  Attaching Access Control List to interfaces

   Access control list typically does not exist in isolation.  Instead,
   they are associated with a certain scope in which they are applied,
   for example, an interface of a set of interfaces.  How to attach an
   access control list to an interface (or other system artifact) is
   outside the scope of this model, as it depends on the specifics of
   the system model that is being applied.  However, in general, the
   general design pattern will involved adding a data node with a
   reference, or set of references, to ACLs that are to be applied to
   the interface.  For this purpose, the type definition "access-
   control-list-ref" can be used.

   This is an example of attaching an Access Control List to an
   interface.

A.4.  Example to augment model with mixed ACL type

   As vendors (or IETF) add more features to ACL, the model is easily
   augmented.  One of such augmentations can be to add support for mixed
   type of ACLs, where acl-type-base can be augmented like in example
   below:

            identity mixed-l3-acl {
              base "access-control-list:acl-type-base";
              description "ACL that contains a mix of entries that
              primarily match on fields in IPv4 headers and entries
              that primarily match on fields in IPv6 headers.
              Matching on layer 4 header fields may also exist in the
              list. An acl of type mixed-l3-acl does not contain
              matches on fields in the ethernet header.";
            }

            identity mixed-l2-l3-acl {
              base "access-control-list:acl-type-base";
              description "ACL that contains a mix of entries that
              primarily match on fields in ethernet headers, entries
              that primarily match on fields in IPv4 headers, and entries
              that primarily match on fields in IPv6 headers. Matching on
              layer 4 header fields may also exist in the list.";
            }
