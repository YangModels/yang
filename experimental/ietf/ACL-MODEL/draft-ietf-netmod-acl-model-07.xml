    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements to configure
   device forwarding behavior.  It is used in many networking concepts
   such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.</t>
      <t>An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
   networking device.  Each rule is represented by an Access Control
   Entry (ACE).</t>
      <t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria.</t>
      <t>The match criteria consist of a tuple of packet header match criteria and metadata match criteria.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such as
      address or class of service or port numbers.</t>
          <t>Metadata matches apply to fields associated with the packet but
     not in the packet header such as input interface or overall packet length</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching criteria is
   met. These actions are any operations that would apply to the packet,  such as counting, policing, or simply
   forwarding.The list of potential actions is endless depending on the
   innovations of the networked devices.</t>
   <t>Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh l]) or Access List. 
    In this document, Access Control List, ACL and Access List are interchangeable.</t>

    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC6020"/> data model for the
      configuration of ACLs. It is very important that model can be easily reused
      between vendors and between applications.</t>
      <t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
        filter constructs and actions that they support. Therefore this draft
        proposes a simple model that can be augmented by standard extensions and
        vendor proprietary models. </t>
    </section>
    <!-- problem -->
    <section anchor="design" title="Design of the ACL Model">
      <t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
        common understanding of what access control list (ACL) is. A network
        system usually have a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered
        list of rules, also known as access list entries – ACEs. Each ACE has
        a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria. The match
        criteria consist of packet header matching and metadata matching.
        Packet header matching applies to fields visible in the packet such
        as address or class of service or port numbers.  Metadata matching
        applies to fields associated with the packet, but not in the packet
        header such as input interface, packet length, or source or destination
        prefix length. The actions can be any sort of operation from logging to
        rate limiting or dropping to simply forwarding. Actions on the first
        matching ACE are applied with no processing of subsequent ACEs. The
        model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
        for each ACL and operational state for each ACE. One ACL can be applied
        to multiple targets within the device, such as interfaces of a networked
        device, applications or features running in the device, etc. When applied
        to interfaces of a networked device, the ACL is applied in a direction
        which indicates if it should be applied to packet entering (input) or
        leaving the device (output). An example in the appendix shows how to express
        it in YANG model.</t>
      <t>This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
        create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models.
        The base model is very simple and with this design we hope to achieve
        needed flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model.</t>
      <section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
        <t>There are two YANG modules in the model. The first module, "ietf-access-control-list",
          defines generic ACL aspects which are common to all ACLs regardless
          of their type or vendor. In effect, the module can be viewed as
          providing a generic ACL "superclass". It imports the second module,
          "ietf-packet-fields". The match container in "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings
          in "ietf-packet-fields". If there is a need to define new "matches"
          choice, such as IPFIX <xref target="RFC5101"/>, the container "matches"
          can be augmented.</t>

    <section anchor="nftables" title="Linux nftables">
      <t>As Linux platform is becoming more popular as networking platform,
        the Linux data model is changing. Previously ACLs in Linux were highly
        protocol specific and different utilities were used (iptables,
        ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
	Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been 
	developed. With a single application, it has a single data model for 
	filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the ietf-access-control
	list module proposed in this draft. The nftables support input and output 
	ACEs and each ACE can be defined with match and action.
      </t>
      <t>The example in <xref target="example"/> can be configured using nftable tool as below.</t>
      <figure >
        <artwork >
      nft add table ip filter
      nft add chain filter input
      nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp ip saddr 10.10.10.1/24 drop
      </artwork>
        </figure>

      <t>The configuration entries added in nftable would be.</t>
      
      <figure >
        <artwork >
      table ip filter {
        chain input {
          ip protocol tcp ip saddr 10.10.10.1/24 drop 
        }
      }

    </artwork>
        </figure>
      <t>We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables and IETF ACL
      YANG data models and its extension models. It should be fairly easy
      to do translation between
      ACL YANG model described in this draft and Linux nftables.</t>

      <t>Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
       an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings. That draft included
      an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters, and
      acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula Kraiser,
      Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen, and Phil Shafer.
      Many people have reviewed the various earlier drafts that made the draft
      went into IETF charter.
       </t>
      <t>Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana Blair
        each evaluated the YANG model in previous draft separately and then work
        together, to created a new ACL draft that can be supported by different
        vendors. The new draft removes vendor specific features, and gives
        examples to allow vendors to extend in their own proprietary ACL. The
        earlier draft was superseded with the new one that received more
        participation from many vendors.
      </t>
      <t>Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen
      Schoenwalder for their review of and suggestions to the draft.</t>

    <section anchor="app-additional" title="Extending ACL model examples">
      <section anchor="routeacl" title="Example of extending existing model for route filtering">
        <t>With proposed modular design, it is easy to extend the model with
          other features. Those features can be standard features, like route
          filters. Route filters match on specific IP addresses or ranges of
          prefixes. Much like ACLs, they include some match criteria and
          corresponding match action(s). For that reason, it is very simple to
          extend existing ACL model with route filtering. The combination of a
          route prefix and prefix length along with the type of match determines
          how route filters are evaluated against incoming routes. Different
          vendors have different match types and in this model we are using only
           ones that are common across all vendors participating in this draft.
          As in this example, the base ACL model can be extended with company
          proprietary extensions, described in the next section.

      <section anchor="interface" title="Attaching Access Control List to interfaces">
        <t>Access control list typically does not exist in isolation. Instead,
          they are associated with a certain scope in which they are applied,
          for example, an interface of a set of interfaces. How to attach an
	  access control list to an interface (or other system artifact)
	  is outside the scope of this model, as it depends on the specifics of the 
	  system model that is being applied. However, in general, the general 
	  design pattern will involved adding a data node with a reference, or set 
	  of references, to ACLs that are to be applied to the interface. For this 
	  purpose, the type definition "access-control-list-ref" can be used.</t>
