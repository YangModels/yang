1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Domain Name Service (DNS) SRV Resource
   Records (RRs) [RFC2782] to locate NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] servers and clients.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   NETCONF and RESTCONF are network management protocols that allow for
   programmatic approaches to network device manageability.  Both
   protocols use a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm where clients
   connect to servers to execute protocol operations, and servers
   respond to the operations or sends notifications to the client.  The
   purpose of this document is to provide DNS SRV RRs such that:

           Clients can discover the location of servers for the purpose
           of direct management

           Servers can discover clients for the purpose of device call
           home as defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home]

3.  Service Names

   IANA maintains a registry of service names and port numbers per the
   procedures described in [RFC6335].  The service names maintained in
   the registry can be used with DNS SRV records to allow clients to ask
   for specific services for a specific domain as described in
   [RFC2782].  In addition, these service names can be used for dynamic

   service discovery as defined in [RFC6763].  The following service
   name and port numbers from the registry apply to this document.

4.  NETCONF over SSH and TLS Server and Client

   The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and
   delete the configuration of network devices.  This document defines
   SRV service labels for NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242], and NETCONF over
   TLS [RFC7589].  NETCONF protocol sessions can be initiated by the
   client or by server in the call home.

   _netconf-ssh  Identifies a NETCONF-over-SSH server

   _netconf-ch-ssh  Identifies a NETCONF-over-SSH client for call-home

   _netconf-ssh  Identifies a NETCONF-over-TLS server

   _netconf-ch-ssh  Identifies a NETCONF-over-TLS client for call-home

   Examples: NETCONF Service Records

        _netconf-ssh._tcp       SRV 0 1 830  netconf-server.example.com.
        _netconf-ch-ssh._tcp    SRV 0 1 4334 netconf-client.example.com.
        _netconf-tls._tcp       SRV 0 1 830  netconf-server.example.com.
        _netconf-ch-tls._tcp    SRV 0 1 4335 netconf-client.example.com.

   NETCONF clients and servers needs additional information in order to
   establish sessions.  How this information is derived is not specified
   in this document, but described in [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home].

5.  RESTCONF

   RESTCONF is an HTTP-based protocol that provides a programmatic
   interface for accessing data defined in YANG, using the datastores
   defined in NETCONF.

   RESTCONF is defined on top of HTTP, but due to the sensitive nature
   of the information conveyed, RESTCONF requires that the transport-
   layer protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, such
   as are provided by the TLS protocol [RFC5246].  HTTP sessions can be
   initiated by the RESTCONF client or by the RESTCONF server in the
   case of RESTCONF call home.  This specification adds two new SRV
   service labels for RESTCONF:

   _restconf-tls  Identifies a RESTCONF server

   _restconf-ch-tls  Identifies a RESTCONF client for call-home

   Examples: Service Records

         _restconf-tls._tcp    SRV 0 1 443  restconf-server.example.com.
         _restconf-ch-tls._tcp SRV 0 1 4336 restconf-client.example.com.

   RESTCONF clients and servers needs additional information in order to
   establish sessions.  How this information is derived is not specified
   in this document, but described in [I-D.ietf-netconf-call-home].

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations spelled out in the DNS SRV specification
   [RFC2782] apply.  In general, the usage of DNSSEC [RFC4033] is
   recommended in environments where DNS cannot be trusted.

   The usage of multicast DNS protocols to discover network management
   services potentially introduces new security risks since such
   protocols usually assume cooperating participants.  In an environment
   where antagonistic participants exists, it is necessary to deploy
   additional security mechanism such as DNSSEC to securely discover
   network management services.
