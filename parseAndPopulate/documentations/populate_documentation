Simple python script which iterates through prepared json dictionaries made from capabilities.xml files
and populates yang catalog with:

    implementation data
        platform
        os-type
        os-version
        feature-set

    protocols data
        netconf
            netconf-version
            capabilities
        restconf
            restconf-version
            capabilities

    modules data
        module
            name
            revision
            schema
            namespace
            feature
            deviation
            conformance-type
            reference
            prefix
            yang-version
            organization
            description
            contact
            submodule
                name
                revision
                schema

Steps of how it is done:
    1, Runs the hello message parsing python script
    2, Loads all json file to the list of data
    3, Iterates through the list and sends a PUT request for each file with body containing the root catalog and
       its list with keys - platform, os-type, os-version, feature-set
    4, Iterates through the list and sends a PATCH request for each file with body containing the all the protocols data
    5, Iterates through the list and sends a PATCH request for each file with body containing the all the modules data
    6, Removes all the json files created when parsing hello message.
