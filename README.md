YANG
=====

This repository contains a collection of YANG modules:

  * IETF standards-track YANG modules
  * OpenDaylight open source YANG modules
  * IEEE experimental YANG modules
  * Broadband Forum standard YANG modules
  * Vendor-specific YANG modules
  * Open source YANG tools

# Contribution Procedures

## Direct Contributions

This is the preferred method of contribution. With this approach you pick where your models will reside in the directory hierarchy, and manage the files mainly in your own fork of the main repository, submitting a pull request when you wish to make public updated models.  All push requests must be reviewed by at least one of the repository's Committers, so when pushing a PR, please assign it to one of the committers.

You can find a tutorial here for how to do push requests. Note that there are at least two different approaches to how to do Pull Requests: using a shell/commandline or using the web interface, so if you do not find what you need below, look elsewhere or ask the committers for pointers.

By convention, there should also be a `check.sh` script provided by the contributors, which should be referenced from the [`travis.yml`](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/master/.travis.yml) file for CI builds. Multiple examples are already in place to copy and modify as required.


## Contributions Via Submodules

Standards bodies or vendors may also provide models to the main repository via a git submodule. Examples of this can be see under [https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/standard](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/standard), with the BBF and MEF submodules. By convention, if a submodule is used, there should also be an equivalent `check.sh` provided by the contributors, which should be referenced from the [`travis.yml`](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/master/.travis.yml) file for CI builds. An example of this may be found [in the BBF's submodule](https://github.com/BroadbandForum/yang), and a sample invocation [here](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/b8ad913fb4cc20ca21b59da1bd8df5cc2927a8e1/.travis.yml#L17).

Direct contributions to the top level of the repository are not encouraged; instead each "organization" should create a top-level folder as described above.


## A summary of the suggested process is:

1. Create a fork of [https://github.com/YangModels/yang](https://github.com/YangModels/yang)
1. Enable Travis on your fork
1. Add your source git repository as a submodule to your fork:
    - Clone your fork
    - cd into vendor or standards directory (depending on the source of your models)
    - `git submodule add https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git <name>`
1. Add appropriate entry to the `.travis.yml` file to check your models.
1. Note: this requires a call to a `check.sh` script provided by the contributors, which should be referenced from the [`travis.yml`](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/blob/master/.travis.yml) file for CI builds. Multiple examples are already in place to copy and modify as required, but in general, one is present at the top-most level of each major submodule area.
1. Commit changes to your fork
1. Test the Travis CI run of your fork as well as test it by running the testall.sh script from the top level directory.
 
After you've verified that the submodule addition and module checking is working ok, submit a PR to the main repository. This will take the latest commit from your repository and make it available as a submodule.

Subsequently, when an updated set of models needs to be released, fork, clone, update submodule, commit and submit PR, also ensuring that Travis is again enabled on your fork to allow pre-pull request checks.

All Pull Requests must be reviewed and as such one of the repository's Committers must review the request prior to actually committing the request.  Changes may be suggested during this process, so patience is requested during this process.


## Travis CI Jobs

In general, pull requests will not be accepted without `check.sh` scripts being in place and a clean Travis CI build being achieved. As can be seen from existing check scipts, all of which use `pyang` today, the bar is set fairly low. The minimum requirement is that the models contributed compile correctly such that `pyang` plugins such as the tree plugin will function correctly, and the schema tree is available for interrogation and tasks such as code generation.

As noted above, the check scripts today depend on `pyang`, and, as of writing, this tool does not support validation of content such as regular expressions or XPath constraints. **As such, models available in this repository may not be accepted by tools that perform more complete semantic validation.** An example of such a tool is the OpenDaylight controller.
