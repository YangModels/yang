### Description

New 'flags' were added to both MAC table and MAC detail table and as MAC detail table includes MAC table in the generated yang file, the flags had to be renamed to flags-xr which got flagged as the deletion of the old flags field. As this is already in a release, adding this to the non-backward-compatible list.
