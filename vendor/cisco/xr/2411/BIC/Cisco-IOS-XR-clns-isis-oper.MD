### Description

Change in Yang tool corrected strings repair-s-rv6* to repair-srv6*, end-xsid* to end-x-sid*, and is-s-rv6 to is-srv6. Changed avg-dela-rawy to avg-delay-raw to fix misspelling. Changed SRv6 function-type to sid-behavior, uint32_t to mgmt_srv6_sid_fmt, and num-sid to num-sids for consistency and to comply with current IETF ISIS SRv6 draft.
