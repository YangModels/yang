## XPaths Obsoleted

### Description
Removed the whitelist CLI/XPATH from appearing on switching (non-routing) platforms as not supported.

### Reason
Whitelist CLI/XPATH isn't supported on switching (non-routing) platforms. ETA was originally written for routers and switching support was later added (by switching team), however, unsupported whitelist CLI/XPATH was prevented from appearing on unsupported platforms. Obsoleted only on switching platforms
