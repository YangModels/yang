  description
    "This module defines a data model for representing a system
    component inventory, which can include hardware or software
    elements arranged in an arbitrary structure. The primary
    relationship supported by the model is containment, e.g.,
    components containing subcomponents.
    It is expected that this model reflects every field replacable
    unit on the device at a minimum (i.e., additional information
    may be supplied about non-replacable components).
    Every element in the inventory is termed a 'component' with each
    component expected to have a unique name and type, and optionally
    a unique system-assigned identifier and FRU number.  The
    uniqueness is guaranteed by the system within the device.
    Components may have properties defined by the system that are
    modeled as a list of key-value pairs. These may or may not be
    user-configurable.  The model provides a flag for the system
    to optionally indicate which properties are user configurable.
    Each component also has a list of 'subcomponents' which are
    references to other components. Appearance in a list of
    subcomponents indicates a containment relationship as described
    above.  For example, a linecard component may have a list of
    references to port components that reside on the linecard.
    This schema is generic to allow devices to express their own
    platform-specific structure.  It may be augmented by additional
    component type-specific schemas that provide a common structure
    for well-known component types.  In these cases, the system is
    expected to populate the common component schema, and may
    optionally also represent the component and its properties in the
    generic structure.
    The properties for each component may include dynamic values,
    e.g., in the 'state' part of the schema.  For example, a CPU
    component may report its utilization, temperature, or other
    physical properties.  The intent is to capture all platform-
    specific physical data in one location, including inventory
    (presence or absence of a component) and state (physical
    attributes or status).";
