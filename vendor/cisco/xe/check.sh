# Vendor-specific check script. Assumes that pyang is on path and that
# all standard modules are on its internal module path.
#
# Deviation modules are NOT checked as they require specific imports
# typically not available locally.
#
# This script will only be run for the last three releases. When a new
# release is added, the current first release (left to right) should
# be removed.
#
# 2020-08-01 einarnn:
#
# Deprecating use of yanglint at least until Focal Fossa Ubuntu release
# is out.
#
# Added note to maintainers to just have the release being checked in
# in `to_check`.
#
# 2017-09-21 einarnn:
#
# 16.4.1 currently excluded because this release does not include all
# "RFC" models required and pyang cannot be configured to pick correct
# ietf-routing draft without versioned imports.
