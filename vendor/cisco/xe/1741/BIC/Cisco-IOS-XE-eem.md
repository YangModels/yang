## XPaths Obsoleted

### Description

## XPaths Deprecated

### Description

## XPaths Modified

- /native/event/manager/applet/event/track/state

### Description

A new when expression added.

### Reason

A dummy cli "event track state any" is created when there is no event command configured. Adding a "when" for track-object solves the dummy cli push issue when there is no event track statement configured
