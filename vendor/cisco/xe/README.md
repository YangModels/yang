This directory contains OS/platform-specific YANG models for Cisco's IOS-XE platforms.

The directory is _currently_ organized by OS-version, with each sub-directory containing the models for that version. The OS version number is presented as a single number. Thus the YANG models for IOS-XE 16.3.1 will be in the subdirectory named "1631". Please note that this organization may change.

A README file may exist in the version subdirectories with any specific notes relating to the models in the directory.
