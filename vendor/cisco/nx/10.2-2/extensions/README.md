## Extended YANG Models and Platform Capabilities for Cisco NX-OS

The YANG files in this directory detail the extended native and OpenConfig YANG models with deviations for Cisco NX-OS, supported by only gNMI and telemetry.  They are not supported by NETCONF, RESTCONF and Cisco gRPC service.

For gNMI and telemetry, users should replace the respective YANG files and its deviations in the parent directory with the corresponding extension YANG files and their deviations.
