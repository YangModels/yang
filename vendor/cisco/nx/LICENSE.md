## Cisco API License, Version 1.1

These terms govern your use of this Cisco Application Programming Interface and associated documentation (“Cisco API”). By accessing, downloading, copying, distributing, calling, or otherwise making any use of the Cisco API, you accept and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “License”). If you are accepting the License on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to do so (either you or the entity, “you”). All use of the Cisco API must be in accordance with this License and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

1. LICENSE GRANT: Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Cisco hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use and make calls to the Cisco API for the sole purpose of developing, implementing, and distributing software applications that work, communicate, or interact with Cisco products or services.

2. CONDITIONS: You shall not use the Cisco API to: (a) substantially replicate and compete with the underlying Cisco product or service; (b) collect, store, or transmit confidential, sensitive, or protected data or information without authorization; (c) disable, disrupt, circumvent, interfere with, or otherwise violate the security of any Cisco product, service, or user; or (d) access any application, system, service, computer, data, account, or network without authorization. The underlying Cisco product or service is licensed under its own separate terms and you shall not use the Cisco API in any way that violates or is inconsistent with those terms (for more information, please visit: www.cisco.com/go/terms ). Failure to comply with any part of this section constitutes a material breach of this License and may result in further repercussions and actions against you, at Cisco’s sole discretion.

3. OWNERSHIP: The Cisco API, in whole or in part, in all forms, is the sole and exclusive property of Cisco. This License does not grant you permission to use any trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of Cisco. If you provide any feedback to Cisco regarding the Cisco API, you agree that Cisco, its suppliers, and its customers shall be free to use and incorporate such feedback into the Cisco API and Cisco products and services without restriction, payment, or additional consideration of any kind. If you initiate or participate in any litigation against Cisco, its partners, or its customers (including cross-claims and counter-claims) alleging that the Cisco API or its use infringe any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right, then all rights granted to you under this License shall terminate immediately.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: CISCO SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR USE OF THE CISCO API, FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, INFORMATION, PROFITS, BUSINESS, OR GOODWILL, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: CISCO PROVIDES THE CISCO API “AS IS” WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, AND ACCURACY, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CISCO. CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CISCO API IS SUITABLE FOR YOUR USE, WILL OPERATE PROPERLY WITH YOUR APPLICATION, IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE, OR IS WITHOUT ERROR OR DEFECT.

6. GENERAL: This License shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to comply with all applicable United States export laws, rules, and regulations. If any provision of this License is judged illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the rest of the License shall remain in full force and effect. No failure by Cisco to enforce any of its rights related to the Cisco API or to a breach of this License in a particular situation will act as a waiver of such rights. In the event of any inconsistencies with any other terms that may apply to the Cisco API, this License shall take precedence.
