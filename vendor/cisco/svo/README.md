This directory contains OS/platform-specific YANG models for Cisco's SVO (NCS Optical) platforms.

The directory is _currently_ organized by OS-version, with each sub-directory containing the models for that version. The OS version number is presented as a three numbers separated by a dot, the first is major release, second is minor and latter is maintenance. Thus the YANG models for SVO (NCS2K) 12.1.0 will be in the subdirectory named "12.1.0". Please note that this organization may change.

A README file may exist in the version subdirectories with any specific notes relating to the models in the directory.
