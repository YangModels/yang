       the value of the 'prio' argument.

       Only the order of the 'apply', 'commit' and 'rollback'
       callback phases will be affected by this parameter.
       The 'validate' phase callbacks are invoked in the
       order they appear in the edit request.

       The 'prio' argument must be a number between 1 and 255.
       If two objects are edited in the same edit request, the
       the one with the lowest SIL priority number will be
       executed first.

       If no sil-priority is set for an object, then the value
       of its nearest ancestor with the sil-priority extension
       set will be used. If there is none, the the default
       value of '255' will be used.

       If the SIL priority is the same for two objects in the
       same edit request, then the server will pick an order
       in an implementation-specific manner.";
