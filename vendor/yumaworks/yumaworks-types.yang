          Normal Encoding Rules:

            - Normal content is encoded as an absolute path.
            - Keys are encoded as a path step within the URL,
              instead of a predicate expression like XPath.
            - The first character must be a forward slash '/'.
            - Each identifier or key encoded in the URL string
              is separated by a single forward slash '/' character.
            - Escaped character sequences are allowed, such
              as '%20' for the space ' ' character.
            - If any descendant nodes of a list are included,
              then all key leafs for that list must be encoded
              in the URL (or escaped with the dash '-' character
              to skip that key).
            - Only key leafs can be encoded within the URL string,
              similar to a YANG instance-identifier or 
              schema-instance-identifier string.  Other leafs
              are not allowed.

            Example URL and XPath strings:

                XPath:  /foo/bar[id='fred'][id2='barney]/baz

              UrlPath:  /foo/bar/fred/barney/baz

            Example showing the 'id2' key leaf escaped:

                XPath:  /foo/bar[id='fred']/baz

              UrlPath:  /foo/bar/fred/-/baz            

         Special Encoding Rules
 
            Since these escaped characters are usually decoded
            by the time an HTTP gateway program will get them,
            the forward slash '/' character needs to be treated
            differently.  To use this character within key leaf
            content, it must be escaped with another forward
            slash character. 

            Example showing escaped forward slash in content:

              XPath: /interfaces/interface[name='1/0/22']/mtu

            URLPath: /interfaces/interface/1//0//22/mtu

         Name Matching

            A parameter using the 'NameMatchMode' data type
            can be used to control how name node searches
            are done for nodes using this data type.

         Alternate Naming

            A parameter using the 'AltNameMode' data type
            can be used to control whether alternative
            node names can be used when name searches
            are done for nodes using this data type.
            
         Exceptions:

            XML namespaces are not ignored, but if multiple
            sibling nodes have the same local-name, then
            the first node found will be used.
