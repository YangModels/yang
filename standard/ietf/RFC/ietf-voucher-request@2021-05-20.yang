             protocol path, then the previously signed voucher SHOULD
             be included in this field.

             For example, a pledge might sign a voucher-request
             with a proximity-registrar-cert, and the registrar
             then includes it as the prior-signed-voucher-request
             field.  This is a simple mechanism for a chain of
             trusted parties to change a voucher-request, while
             maintaining the prior signature information.

             The registrar and MASA MAY examine the prior-signed
             voucher information for the
             purposes of policy decisions.  For example, this
             information could be useful to a MASA to determine
             that both the pledge and registrar agree on proximity
             assertions.  The MASA SHOULD remove all
             prior-signed-voucher-request information when
             signing a voucher for imprinting so as to minimize
             the final voucher size.";
