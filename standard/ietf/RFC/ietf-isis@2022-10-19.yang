    "This YANG module defines the generic configuration and
     operational states for the IS-IS protocol common to all
     vendor implementations.  It is intended that the module
     will be extended by vendors to define vendor-specific
     IS-IS configuration parameters and policies -
     for example, route maps or route policies.

     Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as described in RFC 8342.

     described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
