         frequency index, tn, and a signal PSD level

         (tN, PSDN)], where t1 and tN represent, respectively, the

         estimate is to be calculated, and the highest frequency of 
         highest band over which the capacity estimate is to be

         multi-band xDSL, the set of breakpoints shall describe the 
         stopbands situated inbetween passbands. 

         NOTE – Stopbands may be described as brickwall stopbands 
                using the lowest valid value (–200 dBm/Hz) or may be 
                described more elaborately.

         The breakpoints shall be defined so that tn < tn+1 for n = 1
         to N - 1. The frequency fn corresponding to the index tn can
         be found as: fn = tn * Df. The value of Df = 4.3125 kHz and 
         is independent of the subcarrier spacing used for the DMT 
         modulation of the xDSL.

         The range of valid values for index tn is 0 to 8191 in steps
         of 1. The range of valid values for PSD is –30 to –200 
         dBm/Hz in steps of 0.1 dBm/Hz.

         In the case of an estimation of capacity for a multi-band
