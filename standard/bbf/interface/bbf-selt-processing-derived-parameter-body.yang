         loop segment. In this parameter, a loop segment is defined 
         as delimited by either a loop termination, or the presence 
         of a bridged tap.

         NOTE 1 – Two cables with different gauges/cable-types 
                  connected in series are considered as a single loop
                  segment.

         The loop topology is reported as a list of loop segments, 
         using the following conventions:

         1) The first loop segment in the list shall be the segment 
            connected to the SELT-PMD block measuring the SELT-PMD 
            measurement parameters (i.e., the SELT-PMD block shall be
            the starting point of the topology description).
         2) Subsequent loop segments in the list shall describe the 
            loop in the direction toward the farend loop termination.
         3) Consecutive loop segments indicated as 'bridged tap' 
            represent bridged taps, each branching off from the main 
            loop at the same point.

         NOTE 2 – Identification of a bridged tap branching off on a 
                  bridged tap is not supported by this parameter.
                  A single loop segment is specified with two 
                  sub-parameters: loop segment length (see clause 
                  B.1.1.3.1) and loop segment bridged tap indicator 
                  (see clause B.1.1.3.2).

         If this parameter is supported, reporting of up to three 
         segments is a mandatory capability. Reporting of additional 
         segments is optional. ";

         - Source impedance = purely resistive equal to 100 ohms

                spacing used for the xDSL DMT modulation.

         The range of valid values for the index i is 0 to 8191.
         The range of valid values for TFlog(i * Df) is from +6.0 dB 
         down to –96.2 dB, with a granularity of 0.1 dB. A special 
         value, 32767, is used to indicate that no measurement could
