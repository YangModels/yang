        "The uncalibrated echo response, UER(i* UER_G*Df), shall be 
         represented in linear format by a scale factor and a 
         normalized complex number a(i)+j*b(i), where i is a 
         frequency index i ranging from 0 to NSC–1, the subcarrier 
         spacing, Df = 4.3125 kHz, and (NSC–1) * UER_G * Df is the
         highest frequency supported by the SELT-PMD functionality. 
         The UER granularity parameter, UER_G, has three valid values:
         1, 2 and 3 indicating whether the measurements were performed
         using a tone spacing of 4.3125 kHz, 8.625 kHz or 51.75 kHz. 
         If the uncalibrated echo response is being reported over a 
         frequency range of 17.664 MHz or lower, UER_G shall be set 
         to 1. If the uncalibrated echo response is being reported 
         over a frequency range that is greater than 17.664 MHz and no
         greater than 35.328 MHz, UER_G shall be set to 1 or 2. If the
         calibrated echo response is being reported over a frequency 
         range that is greater than 35.328 MHz, UER_G shall be set to 
         3.

         The scale factor shall be coded as a 32-bit unsigned 
         integer. Both a(i) and b(i) shall be coded as 32-bit 2's 
         complement signed integers. The value of UER(i* UER_G*Df) 
         shall be defined as: 

         UER(i* UER_G*Df) = (scale/2^31)*(a(i)+j*b(i))/2^31. 

         In order to maximize precision, the scale factor shall be 
         chosen such that max(|a(i)|, |b(i)|) over all i is equal to 
         2^31–1.

         NOTE – This data format supports an UER(f) granularity of 
                2^-31 and an UER(f) dynamic range of approximately 
                +6 dB to –186 dB, however it does not imply any 
                future accuracy requirements.

         An UER(i*UER_G* Df) value indicated as a(i) = b(i) = –2^31 
         is a special value. It indicates that no measurement could 
         be done for this subcarrier either because it is not 
         supported by the SELT-PMD function, or that the value is out
         of range to be represented.";
