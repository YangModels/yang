  description "This module aims to represent YANG data as dynamic, allowing the user to provide
               data as variable abstract names. Assignment can be performed, and data
               representation can be made by using variable names instead of values if they are
               not (yet) resolved.

               For example, a mass flow rate can be defined either in its mdot notation when it
               can be resolved, or as a product between a mass density and a volume flow rate.
               The two attributes can be provided by their variable names if the NETCONF client
               does not resolve their values. The NETCONF server can return the corresponding
               mdot value, or if applicable, can return the two attribute values.

               This module defines also various mathematical concepts and objects such as
               vectors, tensors, equations as long as consensus exists. Modeling the equation
               itself is outside the scope of this YANG model. This YANG model scope is to
               define the inputs and outputs of these equations.

               The following table summarizes the mathematical concepts defined in this YANG
               model.

    argument equation-name;
    description "An equation is a list of expressions.

                 The equation is considered well known and easy to obtain a consensus to within
                 the scientific community. It is outside the scope of this YANG model to describe
                 what the equation does. Instead, this YANG model refers to well-known or
                 consensual equations.

                 For example, the mass flow rate equation is well known and has the following
                 accepted expressions:
                 mdot = rho . Vdot = rho . V . A = jm . A

                 Note that this naming uses symbols. Symbols are also defined and are only hints
                 for a human user. Convention should use the name attached to the symbol to get a
                 meaningful notion of what is expressed.

                 An equation can be named for functional programming purposes. An equation may
                 have a value. In the example of the mass flow rate equation, mdot is the value.
                 The value is a function:variable.";

                 operations.

                 The expression is considered well known and easy to obtain a consensus to within
                 the scientific community. It is outside of the scope of this YANG model to
                 describe the relationship between the unknown.
