    "Port-based network access control allows a network administrator
    to restrict the use of IEEE 802 LAN service access points (ports)
    to secure communication between authenticated and authorized
    devices. IEEE Std 802.1X specifies an architecture, functional
    elements, and protocols that support mutual authentication
    between the clients of ports attached to the same LAN and secure
    communication between the ports. The following control allows a
    port to be reinitialized, terminating (and potentially
    restarting) authentication exchanges and MKA operation, based on
    a data model described in a set of YANG modules.";
