          b)If the received logical_link_id value matches 0x7FFF or 0x7FFE and an enabled MAC exists with alogical_link_id variable with the same value, then the comparison is considered a match to thatMAC.
          c)If the received logical_link_id has a value other than 0x7FFF or 0x7FFE and an enabled MAC existswith a mode variable with a value of 0 and a logical_link_id variable matching the receivedlogical_link_id value, then the comparison is considered a match to that MAC.

          e)If the received mode bit is equal to 1 and the received logical_link_id value does not match thelogical_link_id variable, or the received logical_link_id matches 0x7FFE, then the comparison is considered a match.
