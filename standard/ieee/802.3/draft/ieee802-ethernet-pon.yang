	description 
	  "A unique identifier for a MAC within an EPON network. 
	  Logical Link Identifiers (LLIDs) are dynamically assigned by 
	  the OLT during the registration process. For a complete 
	  description of how the LLID is used in an EPON device see 
	  IEEE Std 802.3 subclause 65.1.3.3 for 1G-EPON or 
	  76.2.6.1.3 for 10G-EPON.
	  The third and fourth octets following the SLD contain the mode 
	  and logical_link_id values. OLTs and ONUs act upon these values 
	  in a different manner.
      
	  If the device is an OLT, then the following comparison is made:
      a) The received mode bit is ignored.
      b) If the received logical_link_id value matches 
	  0x7FFF or 0x7FFE and an enabled MAC exists with a 
	  logical_link_id variable with the same value, 
	  then the comparison is considered a match to that MAC.
      c) If the received logical_link_id has a value other than 
	  0x7FFF or 0x7FFE and an enabled MAC exists with a mode variable 
	  with a value of 0 and a logical_link_id variable matching 
	  the received logical_link_id value, then the comparison 
	  is considered a match to that MAC.
      
	  If the device is an ONU then the following comparison is made:
      d) If the received mode bit is equal to 0 and the received 
	  logical_link_id value matches the logical_link_id variable, 
	  then the comparison is considered a match.
      e) If the received mode bit is equal to 1 and the received 
	  logical_link_id value does not match the logical_link_id 
	  variable, or the received logical_link_id matches 0x7FFE, 
	  then the comparison is considered a match.
      f) If the received logical_link_id value matches one of the 
	  assigned multicast LLIDs, then the comparison 
	  is considered a match.
      
	  If no match is found, then the packet shall be discarded 
	  within the RS. If a match is found, then the packet 
	  is intended to be transferred.
      
	  If the packet is transferred, then both octets of the LLID 
	  field shall be replaced with normal preamble octets.
       
	  If the packet is transferred, the one octet preceding the LLID 
	  is passed without modification. A number of LLIDs have been 
	  reserved (see IEEE Std 802.3, Figure 76-4) for various purposes 
	  including downstream broadcast, discovery messages, and upstream
	  registration request messages. An additional block of LLIDs has 
	  been set aside for future use and definition. A registered ONU 
	  shall not transmit frames with one of these reserved LLIDs.";
