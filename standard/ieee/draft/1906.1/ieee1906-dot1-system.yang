                   Communication is the act of conveying a message from a 
                   transmitting party to a receiving party. This includes the 
                   components of message, transmitter, receiver, medium, and 
                   message carriers. In nanoscale communication at one to a few
                   nanometers (nm), in the atomic range, local realism may be 
                   altered by quantum principles and include quantum 
                   entanglement.

                   Communication includes systems with many transmitters and 
                   many receivers, for example broadcast (one to-all), 
                   multicast (many-to-one), and network (many-to-many) 
                   communication systems. The definition of a message includes
                   signals transmitted for control purposes. The definition of 
                   a nanoscale communication network is illustrated in Figure 1 
                   with a single-hop network. The framework discussed in Clause
                   5 builds upon this definition of communication.";
