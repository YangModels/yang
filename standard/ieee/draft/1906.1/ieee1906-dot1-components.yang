  description  "This is the YANG model for the IEEE 1906.1-2015 - Recommended
                Practice for Nanoscale and Molecular Communication Framework.
                Clause 5 - Framework of a molecular and nanoscale communication
                network

                This YANG module is committed to providing a 'flat' description
                of a nanoscale system. A nanoscale system is comprised of a set
                (a list) of components.

                Hierarchy of a nanoscale model or system is out of the scope of
                1906.1.1. For example, declaring that a neuron has an axon, and
                that an axon is comprised of multiple microtubules, is not
                captured in this YANG model. Instead, this YANG module will
                capture that the system has axons and microtubules.

                However, to allow maximum flexibility to scientists, reference
                to other components as siblings and children is offered to any
                model. An adequate design will help rebuild the hierarchy from
                the flat list of components in the model.

                Consequently, a nanoscale device or model may or may not be an
                IETF interface. Such an object may be a pure mathematical model
                of a simulation providing a framework for reusability and cost
                efficiency. If it is intended to be an 'IETF interface-like'
                system, please use the nanoscale-interface convenience
                container.

                A component provides a mapping between any biological model and
                the 1906.1-2015 standard. For example, a microtubule in an
                experiment modelling a neuron can be linked to a 'Field'
                component defined in 1906.1 to get access to the relevant
                metrics. The neuron, albeit different from any other biological
                object becomes somewhat correlated to any other biological
                objects mapped to a 1906.1 'Field' component, thus sharing
                similar metrics and exhibit similar behaviors.
