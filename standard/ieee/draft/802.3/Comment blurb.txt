The 802.3 Working Group follows the comment submission process outlined below. Individuals are invited to provide comments against the code provided at this GitHub site using this process.

Comments must be categorized as Editorial or Technical.  

Comments must clearly identify the location in the draft by page, Sub-clause, and line which is being commented against. 
When commenting against the GitHub code directly the module name should be listed in the Sub-clause field and page may be left blank.

Comments must clearly identify the issue which prompted the comment, specifically what is problematic in the draft that needs correction.  
Comments must clearly identify a specific proposed change, typically by suggesting explicit text needed to resolve the comment. 
Comments that do not include a clearly identify a proposed change may be rejected by the task force.  
The "Must be Satisfied" field should be filled with "No"; it is not used by the Task Force.  

The Excel spreadsheet for submitting comments can be found at:  
http://www.ieee802.org/3/WG_tools/spreadsheet/802d3_TFR_WGB_comments.xls
The complete spreadsheet should be forwarded to the IEEE P802.3.2 (IEEE 802.3cf) Task Force Chair. Contact information can be found at:

During IEEE P802.3.2 (IEEE 802.3cf) review of submitted comments each Proposed Change may be accepted as is, accepted in principle
(the Task Force generally agrees with the issue but prefer a different resolution), or rejected with reason (there is no change 
to the draft).  These responses will be posted at the completion of each review cycle on the project web site listed below: 
http://www.ieee802.org/3/cf/comments/index.html.
