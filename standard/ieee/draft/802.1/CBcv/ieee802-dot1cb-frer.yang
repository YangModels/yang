      "The managed objects that control Stream identification are
       described in Clause 9. The managed objects that control FRER are 
       described in this Clause 10 as follows:

       a) General requirements on the behavior of counters are in 10.1.
       b) The various tables of managed objects that can manage, in
          detail, each individual Stream, are described in five 
          subclauses, including:
            1) Additions (10.2) to the Stream identity table (9.1)
               required for Autoconfiguration (7.11, 10.7).
            2) The Sequence generation table (10.3) that configures
               instances of the Sequence generation function (7.4.1);
            3) The Sequence recovery table (10.4) that configures
               instances of the Individual recovery function (7.5), the
               Sequence recovery function (7.4.2), and the Latent error
               detection function (7.4.4);
            4) The Sequence identification table (10.5) that configures
               instances of the Sequence encode/decode function (7.6);
               and
            5) The Stream split table (10.6) that configures instances
               of the Stream splitting function (7.7).
       c) The managed objects that support the automatic configuration,
          upon receipt of a packet, of entries in the first four of the 
          preceding tables (10.2 through 10.5), are described in the 
          subclause on Autoconfiguration (10.7).
       d) The per-port, per-Stream packet counters that are kept by FRER
          functions for inspection by network management entities are 
          described in 10.8, and the per-port (totaled over all Streams)
          counters in 10.9.

       The managed objects in the subclauses under 9.1 make it possible
       to configure more than one encapsulation for the same 
       stream_handle subparameter on the same port. Similarly, the 
       managed objects in the subclauses under 10.3 and 10.4 make it 
       possible to configure more than one Sequence encode/decode 
       function (7.6) or more than one Sequence generation function 
       (7.4.1) for the same stream_handle subparameter. [The same value
       of stream_handle can be in the frerSeqGenStreamList (10.3.1.1) of
       more than one frerSeqGenEntry (10.3.1) or in the 
       frerSeqRcvyStreamList (10.4.1.1) of more than one
