      "This typedef specifies a Stream ID, a unique identifier of the
      Stream's configuration, used by protocols in the network to
      associate the user's Stream with TSN resources.
      
      The Stream ID is a string that represents two fields:
      
      MAC Address:
      
      A 48-bit IEEE 802 MAC address associated with the Talker sourcing
      the Stream to the bridged network. The entire range of MAC
      addresses are acceptable.
      
      NOTE 1: The MAC address component of the StreamID can, but does not
      necessarily, have the same value as the source_address parameter
      of any frame in the actual data Stream. For example, the Stream ID
      can be assigned by a TSN CUC (see 46.1.3.3 of IEEE Std
      802.1Q-2022), using a pool of MAC addresses that the TSN CUC
      maintains.
      
      NOTE 2: If the MAC addresses used to construct Stream IDs are not
      unique within the network, duplicate Stream IDs can be generated,
      with unpredictable results.
      
      Unique ID:
      
      A 16-bit unique ID that is used to distinguish between multiple
      Streams within the station identified by MAC Address.
      
      The string specifies eight octets, with each octet represented as
      two hexadecimal characters. The first six octets specify the MAC
      Address, using the canonical format of IEEE Std 802, with a dash
      separating each octet. The last two octets specify the Unique ID,
      with the high-order octet, a dash, and then the low-order octet.
      The MAC Address and Unique ID are separated by colon.
      
      stream-id-type is intended for use by other modules as the type
      for a key to a list of Stream configurations (using group-talker
      and group-listener) and a list of Stream status (using
      group-status-stream and group-status-talker-listener).";

        MAC address as a subtype for the stations Chassis ID and Port
        ID. If the station does not use MAC address for its LLDP IDs,
        remote management can be used to associate this mac-address to
        the values provided in the LLDP IDs.

        interface-name may be included in an instance of a container
        using group-interface-id.
        
        IEEE Std 802 recommends that each distinct point of attachment
        to an IEEE 802 network have its own EUI MAC address. If the
        identified station follows this IEEE 802 recommendation, the
        mac-address leaf uniquely identifies the interface as well as
        the station, and interface-name is not needed.
        
        If the mac-address applies to more than one interface (distinct
        point of attachment) within the station, interface-name provides
        a locally assigned name that can help to identify the interface.
        
        When YANG is used for management of the station, interface-name
        is the interface name that serves as the key for the stations
        interface list (RFC7223).
        
        NOTE 1: The TSN CNC is typically located in a different physical
        product than the station identified by this group-interface-id.
        Since the interface-name is assigned locally by the identified
        station, it is possible that the stations product will change
        interface-name in a manner that the TSN CNC cannot detect. For
        example, RFC7223 mentions that the YANG interface name can
        change when a physical attachment point is inserted or removed.
        
        NOTE 2: This interface name can be discovered in the physical
        topology using protocols such as IEEE Std 802.1AB (LLDP). LLDP
        supports interface name as a subtype for its Port ID. If the
        station does not use interface name for its LLDP Port ID, remote
        management can be used to associate this interface-name to the
        values provided in the LLDP Port ID.";

        The value zero is interpreted as one (i.e. no seamless
        redundancy).
        
        This requirement is provided from the Talker only. Listeners
        shall set this leaf to one.
        
        From each Talker to a single Listener, the network configures a
        path that relays Stream data through Bridges. If the Talker has
        more than one Listener, the network configures a tree of
        multiple paths.
        
        num-seamless-trees specifies the number of maximally disjoint
        trees that the network shall configure from the Talker to all
        Listeners. Each tree is disjoint from other trees, in that the
        network evaluates the physical topology to avoid sharing the
        same Bridge and links in each trees paths. This computation of
        disjoint trees is maximal, in that shared Bridges and links are
        avoided to the maximum extent allowed by the physical topology.
        For example, if a single link exists from a Bridge to a
        Listener, and num-seamless-trees is 3, then all 3 trees will
        share that link to the Listener.
        
        When num-seamless-trees is greater than one, the transfer of the
        Streams data frames shall use a seamless redundancy standard,
        such as IEEE Std 802.1CB. When a link shared by multiple trees
        diverges to multiple disjoint links, the seamless redundancy
        standard replicates (i.e. forwards a distinct copy of each data
        frame to the disjoint trees). When disjoint trees converge to a
        single link, the seamless redundancy standard eliminates the
        duplicate copies of each data frame. Assuming that other sources
        of frame loss are mitigated (e.g. congestion), failure of a link
        or Bridge in one disjoint tree does not result in frame loss as
        long as at least one remaining disjoint tree is operational.
        
        If the Talker sets this leaf to one, the network may make use of
        redundancy standards that are not seamless (i.e. failure of link
        results in lost frames), such as MSTP and IS-IS.
        
        If the Talker sets this leaf to greater than one, and seamless
        redundancy is not possible in the current network (no disjoint
        paths, or no seamless redundancy standard in Bridges),
        group-status-stream.status-info.failure-code is non-zero

        of the Stream.
        
        max-latency is specified as an integer number of nanoseconds.
        
        Latency shall use the definition of 3.102, with additional
        context as follows: The Known reference point in the frame is
        the message timestamp point specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS for
        various media (i.e. start of the frame). The first point is in
        the Talker, at the reference plane marking the boundary between
        the network media and PHY (see IEEE Std 802.1AS). The second
        point is in the Listener, at the reference plane marking the
        boundary between the network media and PHY.
        
        When this requirement is specified by the Talker, it must be
        satisfied for all Listeners.
        
        When this requirement is specified by the Listener, it must be
        satisfied for this Listener only.
        
        If group-user-to-network-requirements is not provided by the
        Talker or Listener, the network shall use the default value of
        zero for this leaf.
        
        The special value of zero represents usage of the initial value
        of group-status-talker-listener.accumulated-latency as the
        maximum latency requirement. This effectively locks-down the
        initial latency that the network calculates after successful
        configuration of the Stream, such that any subsequent increase
        in latency beyond that value causes the Stream to fail.
        
        The assumption for when the first point occurs in the Talker
        depends on the presence of the time-aware container in the
        Talkers traffic-specification.
        
        When time-aware is not present:
        
        The Talker is assumed to transmit at an arbitrary time (not
        scheduled).
        
        When time-aware is present:
        
        The first point is assumed to occur at the start of each
        traffic-specification.interval, as if the Talkers offsets
        (earliest-transmit-offset and latest-transmit-offset) are both
        zero. The Talkers offsets are not typically zero, but use of the
        start of interval for purposes of max-latency allows the
        Listener(s) to schedule their application independently from the
        Talkers offset configuration.
        
        The Listener determines max-latency based on its scheduling of a
        read function in the application. Nevertheless, the time from
        frame reception (i.e. second point) to execution of the read
        function is in the user scope, and therefore not included in
        max-latency.
        
        max-latency can be set to a value greater than the Talkers
        interval, in order to specify a longer latency requirement. For
        example, if the Talkers interval is 500 microsec, and
        max-latency is 700 microsec, the Listener receives the frame no
        later than 200 microsec into the interval that follows the
        Talkers interval.";
