    "This module provides management of IEEE Std 802.1Q Bridge components 
    that support the Rapid Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (RSTP).
    The managed objects specified also support those aspects of Multiple            
    Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol (MSTP) and Shortest Path Bridging 
    (SPB) operation that provide plug-and-play interoperability with RSTP. 
    
    References specify constraints on, and consequences of, settings of 
    leaf values and the creation and deletion of list entries. The values
    of all configured objects are retained across system reinitialization.
