    "This YANG module augments the configuration and operational state
    data for interfaces for the MAC Privacy project: Std 802.1AE; see
    that standard and its amendments for full legal notices. 
 
    A MAC Privacy protection Entity (PrY) is a protocol shim in an
    interface stack that encapsulates user data frames in MAC Privacy
    protection Data Units (MPPDUs). Once those MPPDUs are
    confidentiality protected by MACsec, the ability of potential
    adversaries to draw conclusions from the source and destination
    MAC addresses, sizes, and transmission timing and frequency of
    user data frames is reduced or eliminated.
 
    Each PrY in a system and its managed objects augments its upper
    interface (Private Port), which provides a privacy protected
    service to its user, typically a Bridge Port (IEEE Std 802.1Q) or
    an end station protocol stack. Object names can be conveniently
    pronounced by rendering Pry as Privacy";
